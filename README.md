Built for Irvine Hacks 2024


## Inspiration

## What it does
Guess The Lyric is a game that allows a user to input their favorite artists from Spotify and get tested on random lyrics from them. Users can compete to earn the highest score on the leaderboard or earn bragging rights to their friends. 


## How we built it
For the front-end development, we used React.js and Typescript to develop the front end. Axios and Material UI Components were also used to communicate with the backend server and develop reusable components. In addition, we used Python for the backend and used Spotipy library as well as the Spotify API. We used Flask to host a local server to communicate between the front-end and the back-end. With awesome teamwork collaboration as well as attending the amazing workshops hosted at the hackathon, we were successfully able to complete our project!
