# Guess The Lyric
Do you think you're addicted to music too much? Are you watching too many TikToks? Well, worry no further as you can see how much of a fan you are of your favorite artist. : )


Built for Irvine Hacks 2024


## Inspiration

## What it does
Guess The Lyric is a game that allows a user to input their favorite artists from Spotify and get tested on random lyrics from them. Users can compete to earn the highest score on the leaderboard or earn bragging rights to their friends. 


## How we built it
For the front-end development, we used React.js and Typescript to develop the front end. Axios and Material UI Components were also used to communicate with the backend server and develop reusable components. In addition, we used Python for the backend and used Spotipy library as well as the Spotify API. We used Flask to host a local server to communicate between the front-end and the back-end. With awesome teamwork collaboration as well as attending the amazing workshops hosted at the hackathon, we were successfully able to complete our project!

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into include how we processed the data from the backend to the frontend. We stored all the information locally in one React page and had a difficult time being a way to pass the data from one React page to another page efficiently and correctly. Also, we encountered a difficult time finding the correct API for lyrics as certain APIs were not documented well or certain errors were occurring. Thankfully, we were able to resolve the challenges we ran into! 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of what we were able to accomplish within our timeframe. Despite the challenges that occurred, with great determination and morale, we were able to complete our game and plan to add to our project in the future such as adding a leaderboard, adding a database to store user information, and much more : )
## What we learned
We learned many different concepts such as how to construct a REST API for the backend to communicate to the frontend, how to improve API efficiency to conduct more optimal calls, and learning new languages and APIs such as Typescript and the Spotify API. Additionally, we learned how important team communication is when it comes to working collaboratively with others and how "Success is best when it's shared"!
